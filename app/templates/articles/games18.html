<p class="lead">Hello! It's late, but as 2018 has come to a close (and I spent a lot of the past year playing games), I feel it may be worth
    sharing my opinion on some of the titles that I've most enjoyed- old or new- over 2018. Let's get started:</p>

<h3>8: Earthfall</h3>
<p class="lead">
    </p>

<h3>7: Unreal Tournament</h3>
<p class="lead">Unreal Tournament still makes me happy despite the developers neglecting it. There isn't much to say here other than Epic: please update this game.
    There aren't nearly enough arena shooters today.
    </p>

<h3>6: Rainbow Six Siege</h3>
<p class="lead">Rainbow Six: Siege would be top of this list last year, but sadly due to multiple 'mistakes' on Ubisoft's behalf, this game has fallen
    in my list of preferences. The year started... weak, with Operation Chimera introducing two ridiculous operators and a mode that wasn't fun. Operation 
    Para Bellum was good, with Alibi and Maestro bringing some genuinely new and unique ideas into the game, but only to be struck back down by the next update:
    Operation Grim Sky. Grim Sky is my main hatrid for this year's worth of updates, with it replacing the beloved Hereford Base with a 'new and improved' version.
    It was less improved and more just normal. Hereford, whilst being different, was fun. No longer is that the case.
    </p>

<h3>5: HITMAN 2</h3>
<p class="lead">HITMAN 2 is the latest game in the HITMAN series, and also the latest addition to my library. I came to HITMAN 2 with no prior experience playing
    the Hitman games and have loved it from the get-go.
    </p>

<h3>4: DEADBOLT</h3>
<p class="lead">DEADBOLT is a great side-scrolling game produced by the indie devs INSERT NAME. It has a steep difficult curve
    </p>

<h3>3: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
<p class="lead">Counter-Strike: GO was the second FPS I really ground at (TF2 was my first grind, UT3 was my first FPS). 
    </p>

<h3>2: Insurgency: Sandstorm</h3>
<p class="lead">Insurgency: Sandstorm is the Unreal Engine follow up to the wonderful game Insurgency.
    </p>

<h3>1: Insurgency</h3>
<p class="lead">Insurgency is the oldest title on this list, but also one that I have enjoyed since I bought it back in 2016. Insurgency features gritty close quater combat with
    the wonderful Source-Engine-retro-style graphics. The game features a huge arsenal of weapons and gorgeously crafted maps that tend to be very balanced (although sometimes the
    design can be slightly enraging and lead to issues of camping and spawn-sniping).
