<p class="lead">Trigonometric functions are often taken as standard- they are just 'there'.
    They make an important mathematical abstraction through which we can effectively compare
    angles and distances between sets of 3 points.
    <br>
    The common mathematical reasoning for the values of the <code>sine</code>, <code>cosine</code> and <code>tangent</code>
    functions is through the unit circle. The unit circle provides a geometric way to visualize
    the values of the functions at different points.
    <br>
    However, in computers it isn't so easy, particularly with the fact that computers can only 
    represent decimals to a certain degree of precision. However, there are a number of well-developed
    estimation methods that can be used in computers to calculate trigonometric values.
    <br>
    I will be talking about 3 of these here. One is known as the Taylor series, one uses a technique known as 
    the double-angle rule and another uses a very similar rule to the double-angle rule to shrink down a large
    angle into a number of smaller angles.
    <br>
    Some concepts you may wish to know first are <strong>recursion</strong> and <strong>radians</strong></p>

<h2>Using other mathematical functions to approximate trig</h2>

<p class="lead">The website <a href="https://geogebra.com/graphing">Geogebra</a> is a useful tool for checking
    the appearence of graphs and functions. If you go to this website, and set up a function of <code>y = sin(x)</code>,
    it should resemble the shape you're familiar with, passing through zero every interval of π. For particularly
    small values of <var>x</var>, it can be noted that the sine of <var>x</var> is almost identical to <var>x</var>
    itself. Take, for example, <code>sin(0.001) = 0.0009999998... ≈ 0.001</code>. 
    <br>
    We can make a similar statement about <code>y = cos(x)</code>, but instead by using the function
    <code>y = 1 - 0.5x<sup>2</sup></code>. We can make the comparison again with <code>cos(0.001) = 0.9999995... ≈ 
    1 - 0.5 &times; 0.001 (= 0.9999995)<sup>2</sup></code>. You can model the change of this graph on Geogebra:</p>

<p class="lead">So now it's just a case of turning <code>sin(x)</code> into <code>sin(0.001) + sin(0.001) + ... + sin(0.001)</code>.
